This GitHub organisation hosts open-source code, models, and tools developed as part of the Naturkart project, which aims to create a wall-to-wall map of Norway’s nature types covering both terrestrial and marine environments. This GitHub organisation is maintained by the Norwegian Environment Agency ([Miljødirektoratet](https://github.com/miljodir)).

#### **Guidelines** 
- **Open source:** all code is shared under open licenses to promote transparency, reuse and collaboration.
- **Security practices:**
  - Never commit passwords, tokens, or other sensitive data. Use key vaults for secret management.
  - Enable secret scanning, **CodeQL**, and **Dependabot**. Feel free to use additional scanning tools if available.
- **Profile setup:** Add a clear profile picture and include your organisation affiliation. 

#### **Repository Naming Convention**

Repositories are tagged with prefixes based on work packages (sub-maps): 
  - **`nkf-<name>`**: Naturkart Fjell (mountain ecosystems)
  - **`nkl-<name>`**: Naturkart Lavland (lowland ecosystems)
  - **`nkm-<name>`**: Naturkart Marint (marine ecosystems)
  - **`nkk-<name>`**: Naturkart Kalkkart (limestone-related mapping)
